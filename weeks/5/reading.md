Here are some chapters in the Rails Guides that cover a superset of what you'll need to know for your project.

* Chapters 1-5 in the [Rails Guides Section on ActiveRecord](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
* Chapters 1-2 in the [Rails Guides Section on Migrations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html)
* Chapters 1-5 in the [Rails Guides Section on Database Queries](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html)

The Guides are community-written documentation.  Dozens of different developers, at different times, contribute to different sections and chapters.  Therefore, the readability of the guides varies considerably from one section to the next.  **Read what you can, and skip what you can't.**
