# No video this week

The video capture didn't work this week :-(  But don't worry, all of the code I wrote in class is now posted in the [Week 2 Code Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/kiei925-winter14/week2).  You don't need to fork this repository, you can just use it for reference by viewing it online or "Cloning" it to your laptop.  To clone it, look for the "Clone in Desktop" button in the bottom-right of the repository web page.
